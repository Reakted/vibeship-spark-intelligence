# Agent Startup Builder

Build skill.md-driven agent products fast: landing page, onboarding, APIs, security, and abuse prevention.

## Quickstart
1. Edit `agent_startup.md` with your product concept.
2. Use `templates/` to generate your first skill, API spec, and landing copy.
3. Follow the architecture, security, and abuse docs in `docs/`.

## What This Produces
- `skill.md` onboarding contract for agents
- Landing page copy and UX flow
- API surface + data model
- Security, privacy, and abuse prevention policy
- Supabase-ready schema and guardrails

## Folder Layout
- `agent_startup.md`: primary spec input
- `templates/`: starter files (skill, API spec, landing copy, schema)
- `docs/`: architecture, builder flow, abuse policy, Supabase security, research notes

## Notes
- This is a framework. It is designed to be extended into a generator later.
- The default posture is secure-by-design and privacy-first.
