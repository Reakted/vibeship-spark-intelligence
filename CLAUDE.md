## Spark Intelligence Overview

Spark captures runtime events into a local queue, processes them in a bridge cycle, and extracts learnings (cognitive insights, memory bank entries, EIDOS distillations). Meta-Ralph quality-gates what gets stored, outcomes feed back into reliability, and Advisor/Context Sync surface those learnings before actions. When semantic retrieval is enabled, Advisor extracts intent from the task, applies trigger rules, runs embedding search over stored insights, fuses scores (similarity + recency + outcome), and returns top guidance with "why" so learnings actually show up in real work.
