- **Protocol 1: Claim Budgeting.** You get a fixed claim budget. Three strong claims without a citation is a fail. Ten vague claims without mechanisms is a fail. Highlight strong claims, add a source or narrow scope for each, and re-run until it passes. This protocol is for any team that produces public-facing assertions. *Quick run: take your last published document. Highlight every sentence that asserts a fact or a should.

## Project Focus
- Phase: discovery

## Project Questions
- What is the project goal in one sentence?
- How will we know it's complete?
- What could make this fail later?

## Outcome Check-in
- Set v1 ship targets: 50,000 words; 120+ footnotes; tone = pragmatic manifesto + technical civic playbook; include codex puzzles.
- Yes let's do it and think holistically. I don't know what that means right now but think holistically and question yourself. And always serve humanity. Don't fo
