## Spark Intelligence Overview

Spark captures runtime events into a local queue, processes them in a bridge cycle, stores learnings (cognitive insights, memory banks, EIDOS distillations), and surfaces guidance via Advisor and context sync. Outcomes and Meta-Ralph feedback close the loop. Optional semantic retrieval adds intent-based matching with embeddings and trigger rules for higher-quality advice.
