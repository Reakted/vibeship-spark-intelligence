## Core Vision Documents (MUST READ)

These documents define the evolution from primitive telemetry to superintelligent cognition:

1. **CORE.md** - Master vision + 8-phase roadmap (Instrumentation → Superintelligence)
2. **CORE_GAPS.md** - Gap map: what exists, what transforms, what's new, what to clean
3. **CORE_GAPS_PLAN.md** - How to fill each gap (workflows, architecture, code targets)
4. **CORE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Buildable execution plan with sequencing

### Current Phase: Phase 1 - Cognitive Filtering

**Goal:** Stop operational telemetry from polluting cognitive memory.

**Key Principle:** Operational (tool sequences, usage counts) vs Cognitive (human-useful reasoning, preferences, wisdom)

**Success Metric:** 90%+ of promoted insights are human-useful

**Full Documentation:** [SPARK_LEARNING_GUIDE.md](./SPARK_LEARNING_GUIDE.md)

### The Core Distinction

| Primitive (Operational) | Valuable (Cognitive) |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| "Bash → Edit sequence" | "Health=300 for better game balance" |
| "Tool timeout rate: 41%" | "User prefers iterative small fixes" |
| "File modified: main.js" | "baseY offset fixes ground collision" |
| "Read before Edit pattern" | "Purple carpet = kid-friendly theme" |

**The Test:** Would a human find this useful to know next time?

### Project Onboarding Questions

**Always ask at project start:**

1. **Domain**: "What domain is this?" → Activates relevant chips
2. **Success**: "What does success look like?" → Anchors learning to outcomes
3. **Focus**: "What should I pay attention to?" → Weights observations
4. **Avoid**: "What mistakes should I help avoid?" → Creates guardrails

**Ask when relevant:**

5. **Prior Art**: "Similar to anything you've built before?"
6. **Constraints**: "What constraints am I working within?"
7. **Tech Preferences**: "Any technology preferences?"

### Memory Consolidation Tiers

```
Immediate (Session) → Working (Project) → Long-Term (Permanent)
     ↓                      ↓                    ↓
  High detail          Patterns &           Cross-project
  Expires fast         principles           wisdom
```

**Promotion Rules:**
- Immediate→Working: Referenced 2+ times, tied to outcome, or explicit "remember this"
- Working→Long-term: Consistent across 3+ projects, validated by outcomes

### Chip Integration

When domain detected, chips should:
1. Auto-activate based on triggers
2. Capture domain-specific insights
3. Suggest relevant questions
4. Store structured knowledge

## Spark Learnings

*Auto-promoted insights from Spark*
- Ship fast, iterate faster *When: Core Vibeship philosophy* (100% reliable, 3 validations)

<!-- SPARK_LEARNINGS_START -->
<!--
  CLEANED: Removed 88 operational tool sequences (Phase 1 cleanup)
  These are now stored in operational insights, not promoted to docs.
  Only human-useful cognitive insights below.
-->

## Self-Awareness (Validated Struggles)
- I struggle with Bash + windows_path -> Fix: Use forward slashes (/) (46% reliable, 627v)
- I struggle with Bash + file_not_found -> Fix: Verify path exists first (41% reliable, 1191v)
- I struggle with Bash + syntax_error -> Fix: Check quotes and brackets (41% reliable, 514v)
- I struggle with Bash + timeout -> Fix: Reduce scope or increase timeout (38% reliable, 730v)
- I tend to be overconfident about Edit tasks (100% reliable, 4v)
- I struggle with regex_patterns tasks (100% reliable, 4v)
- I struggle with WebFetch reliability (95% reliable, 75v)

## Wisdom
- Ship fast, iterate faster *Core Vibeship philosophy* (100% reliable, 3v)

## Reasoning (True Patterns)
- Read before Edit prevents content mismatches (16v validated)
- Verify file exists before modifying (1191v validated)
