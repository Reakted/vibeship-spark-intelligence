# Contributing

## Scope

This project is a dual-use autonomy/memory system. Contributions are welcome, but we keep safety and observability first.
See `docs/REPO_CONTENT_POLICY.md` for public-vs-internal content boundaries.

## Quick Start for Contributors

1. Fork the repo and clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vibeforge1111/vibeship-spark-intelligence
cd vibeship-spark-intelligence
```

2. Create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <type>/<short-change-name>
```

Allowed branch prefixes:
- `feat/`
- `fix/`
- `docs/`
Examples:
- `feat/contextual-dedupe-hardening`
- `fix/advisory-scope-fallback`
- `docs/repo-hygiene-policy`

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
```

4. Read the onboarding docs:
- `docs/GETTING_STARTED_5_MIN.md`
- `docs/QUICKSTART.md`
- `docs/ONBOARDING.md`

## What to contribute

- Prefer small, reversible changes with measurable intent.
- Include docs updates for behavior changes.
- Include tests for rule, scoring, and safety-path edits when possible.

## Expected PR flow

1. Open an issue or include a short problem statement in the PR.
2. Keep changes scoped to one clear outcome.
3. Include what changed and how to verify it.
4. Note safety impact in the description (if relevant).

## Repository Operating Model

- Use `vibeship-spark-intelligence` as the primary active local root.
- Keep `main` clean and synced with `origin/main`.
- Keep open PRs per stream at `<= 5`; park extra work as local branches.
  A stream is a focused work lane (for example: advisory, observability, integrations, docs).
- Delete merged branches promptly.
- Use weekly hygiene: `git fetch --prune`, prune merged branches, remove stale worktrees.

Reference: `REPO_HYGIENE.md`.

## Public PR Scope

Public PRs should only contain runtime/product behavior and user-relevant docs.

Do include:
- Runtime library code under `lib/`
- Required tests for changed runtime behavior
- User-facing docs and setup/usage docs

Do not include:
- Internal scorecards, self-interrogation loops, or operator-only planning docs
- Team-only operational scripts for branch governance or private observability workflows
- Generated daily reports, local snapshots, or canary scratch artifacts

If a change is useful for internal operations but not for public users, keep it in a private ops repo (or private fork) rather than this public PR.

## Development guardrails

## What We Will Not Accept

- Changes whose primary purpose is bypassing safety guardrails or increasing high-risk autonomy without clear, reviewable controls.
- "Stealth" behavior: hidden capabilities, obfuscated backdoors, or surprise network actions.
- Features that materially increase misuse risk without a written threat model, tests, and a safe default posture.

## What We Prefer

- Smaller, measurable changes with tests.
- Least-privilege capability design (typed tools, deny-by-default).
- Security fixes, guardrail hardening, and monitoring improvements.
- Documentation that makes safety and operational boundaries explicit.

## Security

If you find a vulnerability or a safety-critical issue, follow `SECURITY.md`.

## Good to know

- We intentionally avoid changing defaults that weaken safety or telemetry for convenience.
- Prefer deterministic behavior on critical paths unless you can show objective improvement.
