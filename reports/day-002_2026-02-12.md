# Day 002 — 2026-02-12

## TL;DR
Today was a **hybrid progress + friction** day.
- We shipped real docs and bridge improvements.
- We improved Pulse chat behavior (shorter command replies, less noisy).
- We did **not** finish full Pulse→OpenClaw channel-grade parity yet (last-mile bridge still flaky).

## What Worked

1. **Major docs shipped + pushed** (`vibeship-spark-intelligence`)
   - `docs/reports/2026-02-12_kimi_auth_enablement_runbook.md`
   - `docs/reports/2026-02-12_major_gaps_and_closure_plan.md`
   - commit: `0aa3afc`

2. **Forge connector upgrade shipped + pushed** (`spark-forge`)
   - `src/spark_forge/generator.py` now supports hosted Ollama route:
     - `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` / `OLLAMA_HOST`
     - `OLLAMA_API_KEY` / `OLLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY`
   - commit: `07474cc`

3. **Pulse reliability/UX patches shipped + pushed** (`vibeship-spark-pulse`)
   - OpenClaw bridge path scaffold in `app.py`
   - command response behavior improved
   - `status` command now summarized in chat (full output retained for panel)
   - commits:
     - `7f47f34`
     - `5124acb`

4. **User comms / narrative work completed**
   - Spark article drafted and shared
   - account strategy guidance delivered and used

5. **Creative velocity maintained**
   - Built one-file games in workspace:
     - `chaos-game.html`
     - `quantum-snake.html`
     - `neon-hop.html`

## What Failed / Still Broken

1. **Pulse-as-OpenClaw-channel parity not complete**
   - Goal: Pulse should behave exactly like this OpenClaw chat path.
   - Current: split-path leakage reduced, but full transport parity is not fully stable.

2. **Bridge transport instability**
   - WebSocket handshake/auth/session/agent wait path still inconsistent from Pulse backend.
   - Symptoms included empty response/hanging paths during bridge test attempts.

3. **Environment visibility mismatch**
   - Expected Ollama cloud env vars were not visible in active runtime context (earlier checks showed unset).

4. **Command-mode side effects**
   - `status` command previously produced oversized payloads and confusing delivery behavior; improved, but broader command UX still needs consistency checks.

---

## Fixes Applied Today

### In `vibeship-spark-pulse/app.py`
- Added OpenClaw bridge plumbing + config fields.
- Added hard cutover direction (OpenClaw-first behavior, reducing local split-brain fallback paths).
- Adjusted command response strategy:
  - avoid relying solely on streamed UI path for visible message,
  - summarize `status` in chat,
  - preserve full output separately for panel display.

### In `spark-forge`
- Added hosted Ollama endpoint + auth header support in generator call path.

### In `vibeship-spark-intelligence`
- Added actionable runbooks/plans for Kimi auth + major gap closure.

## Key Insights (honest)

1. **Architecture insight:**
   Pulse should be treated as a **channel frontend**, not a second chat brain.

2. **Reliability insight:**
   If transport is uncertain, always return a deterministic user-visible response path first; stream should be additive, not required.

3. **Methodology insight:**
   Real-use validation catches gaps quickly (tone mismatch, latency, delivery drops) that tests/docs alone won’t reveal.

4. **Execution insight:**
   Frequent small commits + transparent checkpoint summaries kept progress clear despite unresolved bridge complexity.

---

## Honest Scores (today)

- Runtime health stability: **8/10**
- Shipping velocity: **9/10**
- Documentation quality: **9/10**
- Pulse/OpenClaw parity progress: **5/10**
- End-to-end bridge reliability: **4/10**
- Overall day score: **7/10**

Rationale: strong shipping + clarity, but core objective (full channel-grade Pulse parity) still incomplete.

---

## Next-Day Goals (priority order)

1. **Finish Pulse-as-channel bridge (P0)**
   - Single canonical transport path into OpenClaw main session.
   - No local fallback behavior that diverges from main chat.
   - Pass 5-message smoke test with zero drops.

2. **Lock parity behavior (P0)**
   - Style, latency, and response shape must match this chat path.
   - Add explicit ack + fallback diagnostics for missed deliveries.

3. **Ollama cloud env hookup verification (P1)**
   - Confirm runtime env visibility where forge actually executes.
   - Validate first successful Kimi cloud route end-to-end.

4. **Continue strict retrieval A/B execution (P1)**
   - Complete matched `semantic_only` vs `hybrid_agentic` comparison table.

5. **Checkpoint hygiene (P1)**
   - Continue advisory acted/skipped logging discipline.

## Final note to Meta
Today moved us forward materially, but not all the way. We reduced split behavior and improved UX, yet the last-mile bridge parity is still the main blocker. Tomorrow’s first win should be: **Pulse channel path fully stable and identical to this chat.**
